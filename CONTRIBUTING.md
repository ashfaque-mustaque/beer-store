## Raising an Issue

If you'd like to contribute to this project, but you're not sure where to start, or if you've identified a bug or a feature request, raising an issue is the first step:

1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/beer-store/issues) section of our GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "New Issue" button.
3. Provide a descriptive title and a clear description of the issue or feature you want to work on.
4. Use appropriate labels and milestones if they are available.

Our maintainers will review your issue and, if necessary, provide guidance or clarification. We will also use your issue to track the progress of your contribution.

## Assigning Work

At Your Project Name, I assign work to contributors who have expressed interest in specific issues or features. Here's how you can request to be assigned work:

1. After raising an issue, indicate your interest in working on it by leaving a comment like "I'd like to work on this issue. Can it be assigned to me?"
2. A maintainer will review your request and, if the issue is suitable for your level of experience and expertise, they will assign it to you.
3. Once assigned, please follow these steps to contribute:
   - Fork the repository.
   - Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
   - Make your changes.
   - Commit your changes with descriptive messages: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`.
   - Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
   - Create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.

Please be patient if your request isn't assigned immediately, as it may take some time for maintainers to review and respond. We'll do our best to help you contribute effectively to the project.

Thank you for considering contributing to Your Project Name! We look forward to working together with you to make our project even better.
